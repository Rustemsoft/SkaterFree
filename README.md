Obfuscation prevents .NET assembly source code recompilation without changing its functionality. Obfuscation deals by hooding the main points of your .NET code.
You need to obfuscate your .NET code because IL (.NET Intermediate Language) code contains all of the information, apart from comments, that is in .NET executable (*.exe or *.dll) files. Using a decompiler a belligerent competitor can easily reverse engineer your .NET apps. To resist this threat, it is possible to obfuscate your assemblies before distributing your software.
The obfuscation process bereaves all unnecessary information used by debuggers from your .NET classes. Also, class, interface, field and method identifiers are renamed to make them meaningless.
By using Skater .NET Obfuscator the obfuscation cannot be reversed.

This is done in the reliable and repeatable fashion when the obfuscation tool depends on a graphical user interface for operation.
